# Logo

The Logo is a reusable React component that takes two props: title and large. It renders a title with the specified size.

title: This prop represents the text content of the title and is required. It should be a string.

large: This prop determines the size of the title.

To use the Logo, import it into your desired file and include it in your JSX, passing the required props.

<Canvas of={Logo.Normal} />
