        <p>
          The declarative runtime isolates a behavior definition of a program
          from its technical instructions and executes declarative statements,
          which represent logical intention without carrying any technical
          details. In this paradigm, there is no segregation regarding what data
          is or not, instead approaches how data is related with others so that
          any type of data including business rules can be added without
          requiring any additional actions such as compiling, configuring,
          restarting as a result of plasticity.

          As the name suggests, the runtime system runs as daemon process and
          accepts an entry through operating system. As soon as an entry
          received, JIT compiler compiles to runnable statements, and hand it
          over to the call stack. Execution of the statement consists of 3
          steps; updating state, adjusting dependency graph and storing, and as
          a result, the statement can produce more statements in order to
          provide logical integrity. Those produced statements will be added
          into the call stack as well for further cycles. Alternatively, a
          statement can return value when all logical transactions completed.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a part of plasticity, all types of statements including business
          rules are considered as data so that statements can be added without
          requiring any further actions such as recompiling, restarting
          etc.&nbsp;

            Origin of name, Nucleoid comes from latin word nucleus-like, which
            is the region in prokaryotic organisms and makes living things, a
            living thing. Maybe, this makes machine a living thing, like
            mentioned in Watson's behaviorism.
